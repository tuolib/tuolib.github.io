Which floor?
Three please.
Are you sure this is?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure.
Hi. Hi. I'm Karen.
I'm sorry. Things are running a little bit late.
Here's the, uh, thing. Do you wanna come this way?
Through here.
So what did you think of the film?
Yeah, I thought it was fatastic. I thought it was, uh, close encounters meets Jean de Florette.
I agree.
I'm sorry. I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Time out.
Great.
And you're from?
Horse & Hound.
The name 's William Thacker. I think, actually, she might be expecting me.
Oh, okay. Take a seat and I'll go check.
I see you've uh.. brought her some flowers.
No.
These are for my, um, grandmother.
She's in a hospital just down the road.
Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone, you know.
Which hospital's that?
Do you mind me not saying?
It's rather distressing disease.
Name of the hospital kind of gives it away.
Absolutely. Sure.
Cheers. 

Oh, yes.

Right, uh, Mr. Thacker.

Will you come this way.

Right.

You've got five minutes.

I brought these, but clearly...

No, they're great. They're great.

Ah, listen, I'm sorry about not ringing back.

The whole "two-names concept" was totally too much for my flatmate's pea-sized intellect.

No, it's a stupid privacy thing. I always pick a ... caroon character.

Last time I was Mrs. Bambi.

Everything all right?

Yes, thank you.

And you're from Horse & Hound. Good.
Is that so? Well.

So, uh...

I'll just fire away then, shall I?
Right.

The film's great.

I just was wondering whether you ever thought of having more horses in it.

Well, we would have liked to, but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.

Space, right, yeah. Obviously very difficult.

I'm so sorry. I arrived outside. They thrust this thing into my hand..

No, it's my fault. I thought this would all be over by now. I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing. I seriously don't know what came over me. And I just wanted to make sure that you were fine about it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely fine.

Do remember that Miss Scott is also keen to talk about her next project... which is shooting later in the summer.

Ah, yes, excellent. Excellent.

Any horses in that one? Or hounds for that matter. Our readers are equally intrigued by both species.

It takes place on a submarine.

Oh, well, bad luck.

But, if there were horses in it, would you be riding them or would you be getting a stunt-horse-double-man-thing?

I'm a complete moron. I apologize. This is very weird. It's the sort of thing that happens in dreams, not in real life. I mean, good dreams. It's a dream, in fact, to see you again.

What happens next in the dream?

I suppose in the dream scenario, I just change my personality because you can do that in dreams and walk over and kiss the girl.

Time's up, I'm afraid. Did you get what you wanted?

Nearly.

Maybe just one last question.

Are you busy tonight?

Yes. 

Right.

Come in. 

Well, it was nice to meet you.

Surreal, but nice.

You are Horse & Hounds' favorite actress. You and Black Beauty tied.

How was she?

Fabulous.

Excellent. Wait a minute. She took your grandmother's flowers.

That's right. Bitch.

Mr. Thacker, if you'd like to come with me, we can rush you through the others.

The others?

Mr. Thacker is from Horse & Hound.

How's it going?

Very well. Thank you.

Have a seat.

Did you enjoy the film?

Yes, enormously.

Well, fire away.

Right.

Did you enjoy making the film?

Yes, I did.

Good.

Any bit in particular?

You tell me what bit you enjoyed the most and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making that bit.

I liked the bit in space very much.

Did you identity with the character you're playing?

No.

Why not?

Because he's playing a psychopathic flesh-eating robot.

Classic.

So, is this your first film?

No, it's my 22nd.

Of course it is. Any favorites among the 22?

Working with Leonardo.

Da Vinci?

DiCaprio.

Of course.

And is he your favorite Italian director?

Mr. Thacker. 

Oh, no.

Have you got a minute?

No.

Yeah, so the thing I was doing tonight, I'm not doing anymore.

I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.

Oh, well, great. Fantastic. That's ... Shittity brickitty. It's my sister's birthday. Shit. We're meant to be having dinner. 

Okay. That's fine.

No. I'm sure I can get out of it.

No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll be your date.

You'll be my date to my little sister's birthday party?

If it's all right.

Well, yeah, I'm sure it's all right.

My friend Max is cooking, and he is generally acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world. But, you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.

It's a hat. You don't have to wear it or anything. 

You haven't slept with her, have you?

That is a cheap question, and the answer is, of course, no comment.

No comment means "yes". 

No, it doesn't.

Do you ever masturbate?

Definitely no comment.

You see, it means "yes."

Oh, my god.

So, uh, tell me, um, Anna, what do you do?

I'm an actress.

Oh, splendid.

What do you do?

I'm actually in the stock market myself, so, not really similar fields. Though, I have done the odd bit of amateur stuff. P.G. Wodehouse. Farce, all that, you know. "Careful there, Vicar." Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. The wages are a scandal, aren't they? 

They can be.

I see friends from university, clever chaps. Been in the business longer than you. They're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. You know, it's no life. What sort of acting do you do?

Films, mainly.

Splendid. Well done. How's the pay in movies? I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?

Fifteen million dollars.

Right. So that's well, fairly good.

Right, I think we're ready.

Bella, can you tell me where I can find...

Sorry. It's down the corridor on the right.

I'll show you.

Quickly, quickly. Talk very, very quickly. What are you doing here with Anna Scott?

Anna Scott? Yes. Shut up.

What did you say to her?

I don't believe it. I actually walked into the loo with her. I was still chatting when she started unbuttoning her jeans. She had to ask me to leave.

So you knew who she was?

Of course I did, but he didn't.

Not instantly, but I got away with it.

What do you think of the guinea-fowl?

I'm a vegetarian.

So, how's the guinea-fowl?

Best guinea-fowl I've ever tasted.


### 39:40

Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected that we really are the most desperate lot of underachievers.
